### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a novice programmer who is fascinated by the world of flutter. Since early 2022 when I first heard about it I immediately fell in love with them. In my head I started getting ideas for numerous applications that will improve my daily activities as well as a deep desire to refresh old websites and take them to the next level
